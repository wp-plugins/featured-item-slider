Featured item slider is the perfect Slideshow for Wordpress. It displays up to 5 Posts or Pages with Title,Description and Image for every Post.

Featured item slider shows up to 5 Posts or Pages in a very nice and powerful Javascript Slideshow. On the left side of the Slideshow it displays a Image for every Post. On the right side, there are all the Titles
(and a small description under the Title) of the Posts/Pages. The Slideshow highlights the active Post and repeats automatically after getting to the 5th Post.  You have a powerful Administration Area to adjust the
whole Layout of the Slideshow. Inserting new Posts/Pages now is as easy as can be. Just choose "Feature in WP-Content Slideshow" when editing a post or a page.
